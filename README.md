# PacMan Clone in JavaScript

This project is a simple Pac-Man clone built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 
It replicates the core mechanics of the classic arcade game, where the player controls Pac-Man to move through a maze, 
collect pellets, and avoid ghosts. The game features basic collision detection, score tracking, and player movement using keyboard controls. 
It is a great demonstration of working with canvas rendering in web development, as well as implementing simple game logic using JavaScript.
